Notes from watching the app traffic:

On startup
- it does an arp scan of the connected network
- connects to TCP/7 , but doesnt send any traffic if connection accepted

On "add device"
- UI asks for the wifi password
- sends to 234.1.1.1 UDP/7001 various sized packets filled with ascii "1"

    sizes:
        557 556 555 554 245 352 132
        557 556 555 554 285 340 218
        557 556 555 554 213 354 262
        557 556 555 554 279 342 256

    looks like it could be an mtu scan, especially since the controllers
    AP mode issues an MTU of 576

- connects to TCP/8189
